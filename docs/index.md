# Install

## Requirements

- Git
- Ansible
- At least 3 VMs with the setup described in [VMs setup](#vms-setup)

## VMs setup

For the setup I used VirtualBox but it should work with any other virtualization software until your VMs have the required configuration.

### VMs requirements

This requirement are the minimum requirements for the VMs. You can use more powerful VMs if you want.

Jenkins VM:

- 2 CPU
- 2 GB RAM (2048 MB)
- 30 GB disk

Kubernetes VMs:

- 4 CPU
- 4 GB RAM (4096 MB)
- 30 GB disk

### Create the VMs

Create 1 VM for Jenkins and at least 2 VMs for the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Creating a VM with VirtualBox

- Open VirtualBox
- Click on "New"
- Name your VM
- Select your "ISO Image" (Ubuntu server 22.04.3 LTS in my case)

You should now be on the "Profile setup" screen.
